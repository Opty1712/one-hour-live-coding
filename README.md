# Technical Interview

## Before Starting
1. You have 1 hour to complete the test
2. We will take the last 5 minutes to review the result
3. You can use any tools you like (Google, Stack Overflow, documentation, etc.)
4. You can use additional libraries and reference existing code that you may have.
5. It’s okay to be silent during the test or feel free to talk - whatever you’re comfortable with. However, describing what you’re doing is encouraged.
6. Write your code as close to the production style, as possible, but mind the size of the project. IE. Redux usage is not enforced.
7. You can use any editor of choice or http://codesandbox.io/. Just share the screen. We have to see all your activities.


## The task

1. Create a React application that will integrate with The Cocktail DB API. 
2. Create an input that as the user types will fetch drinks from the endpoint: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=margarita
> To do this, you need to pass the user input as the "s" query string
3. Show the drinks in a list and add a button to save the drink in a separate state.
4. List the drinks added to the separated state and add a button to remove them from there.
